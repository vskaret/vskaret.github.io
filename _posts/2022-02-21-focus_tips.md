# A tips to increase focus while on the computer and browsing the internet

I am very easily distracted, and often I'll click on something with the best intentions but then end up spending too much time on something completely unrelated that I regret spending time on. Recently I've found a way to setup my computer and firefox browser to mitigate this somewhat.

First thing is to setup a new user for a specific purpose. This sets the context for me and my brain at the moment when I log into the user. If I log into my user SomeStupidProject, I am only supposed to work on some stupid project. While when I use one user for everything, it quickly becomes cluttered with a lot of bookmarks and whatnot.

The second thing is to use the leechblock addon for firefox and block all domains all of the time. Then when you need to open a website, add it as an exception. For some websites I find i can whitelist all of it, for example fast.ai. Other websites, like youtube, I treat very carefully. I find that whitelisting one and one video (or playlist) works quite well.
