# Hello world

I'm a software developer from Mj√∏ndalen in Norway. My first experience with programming was scripting VBA in Excel while studying economics. I remember working day and night scripting excel to automate a bunch of stuff for an assignment and really having a great time with it. Later I figured out that scripting excel was pretty much the only thing I enjoyed about the economics studies, so I went on to study computer science as well. I enjoyed computer science a lot, and this made me extra happy and relieved because of how boring I found economics studies. I think my biggest takeaway from studying economics for 3.5 years is that it is really boring to study economics.

I'm currently following the [fast ai course](https://www.fast.ai/), and will hopefully post a lot about stuff related to that. Jeremy seems like a great teacher.

Timestamps and links from the fast.ai live coding sessions (and sometimes other places) that might be useful:

* There is a bunch of scripts automating getting setup stuff in fastai's [fastsetup repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup), e.g. [setup-conda.sh](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup/blob/master/setup-conda.sh) for installing mamba
