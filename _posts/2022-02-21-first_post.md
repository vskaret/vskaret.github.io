# Hello world

I'm a software developer from Mj√∏ndalen in Norway. My first experience with programming was scripting VBA in Excel while studying economics. I remember working day and night scripting excel to automate a bunch of stuff for an assignment and really having a great time with it. Later I figured out that scripting excel was pretty much the only thing I enjoyed about the economics studies, so I went on to study computer science as well. I enjoyed computer science a lot, and this made me extra happy and relieved because of how boring I found economics studies. I think my biggest takeaway from studying economics for 3.5 years is that it is really boring to study economics.

I'm currently following the [fast ai course](https://www.fast.ai/), and will hopefully post a lot about stuff related to that. Jeremy seems like a great teacher.

Timestamps and links from the fast.ai live coding sessions (and sometimes other places) that might be useful:

* [Install mamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56sIyFjihEc&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=2&t=32m) (python environment thingy)
* There is a bunch of scripts automating getting setup stuff in fastai's [fastsetup repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup), e.g. [setup-conda.sh](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup/blob/master/setup-conda.sh) for installing mamba
* [Using tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=2&t=39m), [simple tmux cheatsheet](https://www.themoderncoder.com/simple-tmux-cheatsheet/) and [basic tmux configuration](https://www.themoderncoder.com/basic-tmux-configuration/)
* [jupyter intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=2&t=49m)
* [How to handle python environments with mamba in such a way that one does not need to freeze version numbers and thus do not need to rely as much on docker containers (specifically for data scientists? the point seems to be to facilitate rapid iteration)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BQiIgiEks&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=3&t=12m)
* [Setup a jupyter notebook in paperspace gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BQiIgiEks&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=3&t=21m50s)
* [Python debugger and set_trace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BQiIgiEks&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=3&t=36m30s)
* Tip: learn the textual python debugger as its similar to debuggers for other languages so the knowledge generalizes (in contrast to learning properietary tools where you will probably have to re-learn it somewhat)
* Tip: in general, use the keybindings that the tools offer instead of coming up with your own keybindings as it's easier to switch between environments
