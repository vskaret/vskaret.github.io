# Hello world

I'm a software developer from Mj√∏ndalen in Norway. My first experience with programming was scripting VBA in Excel while studying economics. I remember working day and night scripting excel to automate a bunch of stuff for an assignment and really having a great time with it. Later I figured out that scripting excel was pretty much the only thing I enjoyed about the economics studies, so I went on to study computer science as well. I enjoyed computer science a lot, and this made me extra happy and relieved because of how boring I found economics studies. I think my biggest takeaway from studying economics for 3.5 years is that it is really boring to study economics.

I'm currently following the [fast ai course](https://www.fast.ai/), and will hopefully post a lot about stuff related to that. Jeremy seems like a great teacher.

Timestamps and links from the fast.ai live coding sessions (and sometimes other places) that might be useful.

Session 1:

* [Install mamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56sIyFjihEc&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=2&t=32m) (python environment thingy)
* There is a bunch of scripts automating getting setup stuff in fastai's [fastsetup repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup), e.g. [setup-conda.sh](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup/blob/master/setup-conda.sh) for installing mamba

Session 2:

* [Using tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=2&t=39m), [simple tmux cheatsheet](https://www.themoderncoder.com/simple-tmux-cheatsheet/) and [basic tmux configuration](https://www.themoderncoder.com/basic-tmux-configuration/)
* [jupyter intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=2&t=49m)

Session 3:

* [How to handle python environments with mamba in such a way that one does not need to freeze version numbers and thus do not need to rely as much on docker containers (specifically for data scientists? the point seems to be to facilitate rapid iteration)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BQiIgiEks&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=3&t=12m)
* [Setup a jupyter notebook in paperspace gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BQiIgiEks&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=3&t=21m50s)
* [Python debugger and set_trace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BQiIgiEks&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=3&t=36m30s)
* Tip: learn the textual python debugger as its similar to debuggers for other languages so the knowledge generalizes (in contrast to learning properietary tools where you will probably have to re-learn it somewhat)
* Tip: in general, use the keybindings that the tools offer instead of coming up with your own keybindings as it's easier to switch between environments
* [It's fine to use pip to install anything that's only reliant on python code. When you install stuff that relies on code outside of python like pytorch (relies on cuda) it's faster to use conda as it also handles the dependencies outside of python. Sometimes you need to use pip as it let's you install something only on your user in cases where you are not admin: pip install -U --user package_name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BQiIgiEks&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM&index=4&t=46m10s)
* In paperspace, everything on the machine is whiped out after you're finished. However, you have a /storage folder where stuff is stored persistantly. Use this and symlinks (ln -s path_to_file_to_symlink) to not have to install stuff again each time you start the machine
* In paperspace, you can create a file called .bash.local in storage which will be run everytime you open the terminal. Create symlinks there :)
* When opening a paperspace notebook, /run.sh is executed. This script can't be changed, but it will execute /storage/pre-run.sh which might be a better place to put the symlinks and stuff like that

Session 4:

* Virtues of a great programmer: laziness, impatience and hubris. One way of being lazy is to learn stuff that is re-usable, such as using python for scripts rather than shell because python can be used for more purposes.

Terminal tricks:

* !! last command
* !$ last token in last command
* ctrl + u: delete everything left of the cursor
* ctrl + k: delete everything right of the cursor
