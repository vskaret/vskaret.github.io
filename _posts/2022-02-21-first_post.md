# Hello world

This is the first post on this blog.

I'm a software developer from Mj√∏ndalen in Norway. My first experience with programming was scripting VBA in Excel while studying economics. I remember working day and night scripting excel to automate a bunch of stuff for an assignment and really having a great time with it. Later I figured out that scripting excel was pretty much the only thing I enjoyed about the economics studies, so I went on to study computer science as well starting in 2016. I really enjoyed the computer science studies, and I knew that for a fact because I could compare it to how boring I found economics.

I'm currently following the [fast ai course](https://www.fast.ai/), and will hopefully post a lot about stuff related to that.

Timestamps from the fast.ai live coding sessions (these are for myself to go back to):
